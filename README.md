# Welcome to PillarX!

## PillarX is an ecosystem of trustable web3 apps all in one place. We've taken care of the infrstructure and account management so you don't need to.

üõ†Ô∏è **Here to build a PillarX app?** Head over to the [README.md](src/apps/README.md)
file within the `src/apps` directory to learn how to get started.

üí¨ **Need support?** You can get in touch with us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/6MKAy7gv4P) or [Telegram](https://t.me/pillarxdevelopers). We usually reply quickly.

## Want to check out this repository and run it locally?

1. Check out the `main` branch and run `npm i` in the root.

2. We have included a `.env.example` file - copy ALL these values to a `.env` file in the project root. This will ensure that you can run PillarX with no issues.

3. Run `npm start` at the root. This will run PillarX locally on your machine and launch the website in your default browser. To access the login page, add "/login" to the url. On the sign-in page, enter your email address - Privy will send that email address a login code.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Encountering 429 errors?** You may have hit a rate limit for the Etherspot service. PillarX will keep trying but it might be easier for you to register your own API keys for the Etherspot Bundler API and Etherspot Data Service API via the [Portal](https://portal.etherspot.io).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Privy encountering login limits?** You may have hit the maximum user limit for free accounts on Privy. Feel free to [register for Privy](https://dashboard.privy.io) and create an app. This will give you your own App ID which you can use in the `.env` file.
